# rpy2gv
Simple python script to generate a graphviz file and png graph picture out of the "script.rpy" file of a RenPy project.

To get this to work, you need python (https://www.python.org/) and graphviz for python (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphviz) installed on your computer.

Just put the script "rpy2gv.py" in your "game" folder and run it. You should get a graphviz file with the tree structure and a PNG picture with the actual graph.
